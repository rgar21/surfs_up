Using SQlite and Flask to display data on a local host

## Overview of Project:

Compiling and analyzing weather data using SQlite and Python while displaying summaries using Flask API

### Purpose

The intent of this is project is to analyze Hawaii's weather data in order to help investors decide whether opening a surf shop will be viable under usual weather conditions. We will be able to provide investors with a summary of weather data that runs on a local host using Flask API. 

## Results

#### June Weather Summary

### Comparison of June vs December Weather

There are three key differences that are apparent when comparing June and December weather patterns:
  * There is a considerate difference in the amount of oberservations between June (1700) vs December (1517) 
  * There is only a 3 degrees difference in the average temperatures for June and December
  * The minimum temperature in December is on average 8 degrees lower than in June

## Summary 

After analyzing the summaries for June and December we can conclude that the climate in Oahu is relatively steady as can be seen by our average temperatures only being separated by 3 degrees. This bodes well for our business as the temperature will not play a factor in deterring tourists from visiting Oahu. One metric that could present a problem to our business venture is the minimum temperature that is realized in December. We should look into business practices that can help insulate our daily revenue from abnormally cold temperatures. 

There are some further queries we would like to look into in order to gain better perspective on the overall weather. One is to add precipitation data for June and December in order to discover any weather patterns that could potentially impact our venture. Second is to cross reference locational data for weather stations in order to determine where would be the best location for stable weather conditions.
